# RandomEffect
Applies random potion effects to players.

##
Inspired by [Dream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w), this plugin gives players random potion effects with the Harming effect (Potion of Harming) excluded to prevent instant deaths.
The plugin lacks customization, however can be edited by in `Toggle.java` and built from source.
